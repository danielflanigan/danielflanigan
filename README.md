### Hi, I'm Daniel Flanigan

I'm a data scientist and Python developer changing careers after twelve years of experience in experimental physics research.

In grad school I developed kinetic inductance detectors to be used as microwave pixels for astrophyics experiments. As a postdoc, I first developed superconducting parametric amplifiers for quantum physics experiments, then I studied the properties of disordered superconductors with high kinetic inductance. Most of the code here was first written in one of these labs.

[resonator](https://www.github.com/danielflanigan/resonator "resonator") is a library for fitting scattering parameter data from superconducting resonators.
[transmission-line](https://www.github.com/danielflanigan/transmission-line) is a library for drawing GDSII design files for transmission lines, developed to draw superconducting resonators and similar devices.
