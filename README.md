### Hi, I'm Daniel Flanigan

I recently changed careers to software engineering after twelve years of experience in experimental physics research.

In graduate school I developed kinetic inductance detectors to be used as microwave pixels for astrophyics experiments. As a postdoc, I first developed superconducting parametric amplifiers for quantum physics experiments, then I studied the properties of disordered superconductors with high kinetic inductance. Here are a few software packages developed during this research.

[resonator](https://www.github.com/danielflanigan/resonator) is a library for fitting scattering parameter data from superconducting resonators.

[transmission-line](https://www.github.com/danielflanigan/transmission-line) is a library for drawing GDSII design files for transmission lines, developed to draw superconducting resonators and similar devices.
